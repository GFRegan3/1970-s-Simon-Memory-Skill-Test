# 1970's Simon Game

Title {

    This project is a replica, with some updates(outlined below), of the 1970's Simon memory skill test that was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The original version was manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley.

How It Was Made {

    The project was built inside brackets by using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. The orginal project was a tutorial by Beau Carnes hosted through FreeCodeCamp.Org. FreeCodeCamp.Org is a fantasic place that has tons of useful stuff for self taught coders! You can see the orginal post at "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beaucarnes/simon-javascript-game-tutorial--s1M0ntu70" .
